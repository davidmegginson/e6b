      <p>
        This is a free mini-app from <a
        href="https://twitter.com/david_megginson/">David
        Megginson</a>, for fellow pilots who love the classic <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E6B">E6B circular
        sliderule</a>, or for student pilots still forced to learn it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get practice exercises for
        either the wind side or the calculator side. Just keep
        clicking/tapping/hitting a key to see the answer, then to move
        on to the next question.
