===

The [E6B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E6B) is a circular sliderule and mechanical wind-triangle calculator long used in aviation, and still common in flight training (or with pilots like me, who just like them).

This client-side web app presents simple problems for either the calculator or wind side of an E6B. Click/tap/hit a key to show an answer or to advance to the next question.
